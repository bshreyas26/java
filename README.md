# Java Journey: Concepts, Projects, and Data Structures

Welcome to my personal Java repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey and growth in Java programming. Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on implementations of core Java concepts, practical projects I've developed, and my ongoing practice with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## üöÄ About This Repository

This repository serves as a showcase of my learning and development in Java. It's organized to provide a clear overview of different aspects of my work:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**: Practical examples and implementations of fundamental OOPs principles.
* **Projects**: Real-world applications and mini-projects developed using Java.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Solutions and implementations for common DSA problems.

My goal is to continuously expand this repository with new learnings, improved solutions, and exciting projects.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

* ### `oops-concepts/`
    This directory contains hands-on implementations and examples demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java. Each sub-directory within will focus on a specific concept.

    **Examples include:**
    * `abstraction/`
    * `encapsulation/`
    * `inheritance/`
    * `polymorphism/`
    * `interfaces/`
    * `abstract-classes/`
    * `exception-handling/`
    * `collections-framework/`

* ### `projects/`
    This directory houses various Java projects I've worked on. Each project will have its own dedicated sub-directory with its source code and a brief `README.md` explaining the project's purpose, features, and how to run it.

    **Examples of projects you might find:**
    

* ### `dsa-practice/`
    This directory is dedicated to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice. It contains implementations of various data structures and solutions to algorithmic problems, often categorized by type or platform.

    **Examples include:**
